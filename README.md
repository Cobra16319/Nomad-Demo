``This AMI can be used for learning; update if you want to use in production. It has a current version of Nomad and Packer at time of commit

`` Pull in the module and it will create 42 resources and setup all the routes and security groups for 9 instances running on AWS with auto-scaling and Consul and Nomad already configured.
